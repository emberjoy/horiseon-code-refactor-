# <Horiseon-Code-Refactor>

## Description

This Code Refactor Repository was created to make Horiseon's webpage follow accessibility standards for users and to improve the codebase for future web developers. By adding alt text to images and providing links that work, any user will be able to navigate the webpage with ease. By describing, consolidating and organizing the CSS properties and selectors to match the HTML elements, web developers will be able to navigate the code more efficiently.
